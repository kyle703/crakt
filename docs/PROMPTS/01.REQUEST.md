# Idea Refinement

Your task is to **collaborate on developing or refining a project or feature concept**. This prompt solicits iterative feedback to expand a basic idea into a comprehensive, well-structured request.

---

## **Required Inputs**

1. **PROJECT_REQUEST**: A short description of the project or feature’s initial concept.

---

## **Task Overview**

In each exchange, the AI will:

1. Ask questions to clarify the project or feature.
2. Suggest missing considerations or user flows.
3. Organize requirements logically.
4. Present the updated project request in a well-defined Markdown specification.

This ensures you iterate toward a final, clear “Project Request” doc.

---

## **Detailed Process Outline**

1. **User Provides Concept**: User supplies the idea.
2. **AI Gathers Clarifications**: The AI asks targeted questions to flesh out missing details, such as feature scope or user needs.
3. **AI Updates the Specification**: After each round of questions/answers, the AI returns a new version of the Markdown-based request format.
4. **Repeat** until the request is complete, well-defined, and you are satisfied.
